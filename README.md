Happy birthday Dad! I hope you like this personally coded
chrome extension by yours truly to keep you up to date on
your favorite artist!

# How It Works
This chrome extension randomly selects Taylor Swift songs and uses https://github.com/sarbor/taylor_swift_api to pull 4 verses of the song's lyrics. It is your job to correctly select the song title of that Taylor Swift song, which shouldn't be hard for you, super fan!
